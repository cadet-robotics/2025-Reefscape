/*
 * Pipeline tuning:
 *
 * Threads : 3
 * Decimate : Defualt
 * Blur : Defualt
 * Refine Edges: Defualt
 * Max error bits : start with 0
 * Decision Margin Cutoff : start aorund 30, increase for less false possitives
 * Pose Estimation Iterations : start around 50, Increase to reduce noise ( risk wrong pose )
*/

/*
 * Camera Calibration:
 *
 * Print a checkerboard pattern
 * Meassure to verify size
 * Capture pictures are each resolution
 * Use a tag to measue 3d accuracy
